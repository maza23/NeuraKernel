## Abstract

NeuraKernel is an experimental kernel prototype that explores AI-driven dynamic hardware control. Using reinforcement learning (RL), the system aims to optimize CPU frequency and power settings in real time, improving performance-per-watt and thermal stability.

Unlike traditional OS-level governors, which rely on static rules, NeuraKernel integrates sensor data, decision-making agents, and control loops that adapt to changing workloads. This document outlines the motivations, architecture, current prototype, and roadmap for future development.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary operating systems include CPU frequency governors that follow predefined heuristics. While effective for general use, these policies are not adaptive and often fail to achieve optimal power-efficiency trade-offs under variable workloads.

With the increasing availability of AI methods for control and optimization, particularly reinforcement learning, we explore whether a kernel could delegate parts of its hardware management to a learning agent. NeuraKernel is a research prototype in this direction.

Unlike these, NeuraKernel focuses on low-level, real-time control of CPU behavior from within a kernel-friendly loop, aiming to integrate AI decision-making into future OS/hypervisor designs.

> The AI driver collects temperature, frequency, and power (PPT) data from `/sys`.  
> The RL agent reads state as JSON, chooses actions (e.g., +1 = increase freq), and the driver applies them using `cpufreq`.

---

## 4. Implementation (v0.2)

**AI Driver (Rust):**

- Reads CPU temperature, core frequencies, and power (PPT) from sysfs.
- Exports JSON to `/tmp/neurakernel_sensors.json` every 100 ms.
- Accepts discrete actions: -1 (down), 0 (keep), +1 (up) and applies frequency control.

**RL Agent (Python):**

- Uses a dummy PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) policy in PyTorch.
- Input: `[cpu_temp, core0..coreN_freqs, ppt]`
- Output: action ∈ {-1, 0, +1}

**Control Loop:**

- Runs at 10Hz.
- Can be extended to multi-core, continuous control, or multi-agent policy.

---

## 5. Preliminary Results

- Stable real-time sensor readout and control at 10Hz loop.
- RL agent successfully reads state and makes dummy decisions.
- Ready for phase 3: real training with custom reward function (e.g. perf/Watt, thermal thresholds).

---

## 6. Future Work

- Support fine-grained power states using MSRs (Intel/AMD) or SMC (Apple Silicon).
- Add support for ARM and RISC-V boards.
- Integrate performance counters (IPC, cache miss, context switches).
- Extend to GPU/NPU units (heterogeneous control).
- Train real RL policies under stress benchmarks (e.g., Blender, Prime95).



---

## 7. Ethical and Safety Considerations

- Ensure thermal limits and voltage ceilings are enforced at all times.
- Log all agent decisions for traceability.
- Train policies in simulation or safe mode before deployment.
- Make AI decisions explainable (XRL).

---

## 8. Conclusion

NeuraKernel shows that AI agents can participate in low-level hardware management by learning control policies directly from sensor data. While early-stage, the architecture is modular and extensible for future research in AI-first operating systems.

## Appendix A: Architectures and Projects Co-Designed with AI

NeuraKernel draws inspiration from several recent projects that explore the intersection between hardware architecture and AI-based control:

- **MIT AutoPIM** – Co-optimizes memory and scheduling using RL agents.  
- **Gemmini (UC Berkeley)** – RISC-V accelerator optimized for matrix multiply, adaptable to learning-based instruction sets.  
- **OpenPiton-AI (Princeton)** – Scalable manycore system, AI-ready for experimentation.  
- **Eyeriss (MIT)** – Spatial AI accelerator, uses AI principles in hardware layout and control.  
- **DynaPIM (Meta)** – Combines PIM with learning-based reconfiguration.  
- **ZenStates-Linux** and **Koala** – User-space projects that adjust hardware state, albeit with fixed logic.

These projects show that both AI-for-architecture and architecture-for-AI are viable research directions — and NeuraKernel could evolve into a testbed bridging both domains.
